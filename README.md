# Movie-Recommendation-System

The project involves designing a movie recommendation system using Item Based Collaborative Filtering approach. I have used Pearson (correlation)-based similarity as the similarity measure. Apache Spark framework has been extensively used. I used Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service to run the script on a cluster with Hadoop YARN.
