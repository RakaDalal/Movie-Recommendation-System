# Movie-Recommendation-System

The project involves designing a movie recommendation system using Item Based Collaborative Filtering approach. I have used Pearson (correlation)-based similarity as the similarity measure. I have extensively used Apache Spark framework to build the recommendation system and used Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service to run the script on a cluster with Hadoop YARN.
